TITLE OF THE PROJECT

Embedded Solar Tracker System

Problem and Solution
Problem Statement:
Solar energy is one of the most abundant and renewable energy sources. However, traditional fixed solar panels do not adjust to the sun’s position throughout the day, reducing their efficiency and energy output. This inefficiency limits the overall power generation capacity, leading to energy losses.


Proposed Solution:
This project aims to develop a smart solar tracking system using ESP32 that dynamically adjusts the solar panel's position based on real-time sunlight intensity. The system utilizes LDR sensors to track sunlight direction and servo motors to align the solar panel for maximum efficiency. The ESP32 microcontroller enables wireless monitoring and potential integration with an IoT dashboard. This system ensures optimized energy harvesting, improved efficiency, and better utilization of solar power for small-scale applications.
